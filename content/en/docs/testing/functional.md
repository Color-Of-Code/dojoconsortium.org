Functional testing is a deterministic test that verifies all modules of a sub-system are working together. It avoids integrating with other sub-systems, preferring test doubles instead.

## Overview

Functional testing verifies a system's specification and fundamental requirements systematically and deterministically. It introduces an actor (typically a user or service consumer) and validates the ingress and egress of that actor within specific consumer environments.

- Covers broad-spectrum behavioral tests (UI interactions, presentation-logic, business-logic)
- Side-effects are mocked and don't cross boundaries outside the system's control
- Differs from [E2E tests](/docs/testing/e2e) which have no mocks

## Recommended Best Practices

1. Write tests from the perspective of an "actor" (user interacting with UI or service interacting with API)
2. Avoid real I/O to reduce flakiness and ensure deterministic side-effects
3. Use [test doubles](/docs/testing/test-doubles/) when the system under test needs to interact with an out-of-context sub-system
